## Basic Usage

`@hubspot/cms-dev-server` is a package that allows users to start an Express + Vite dev server enabling an auto-reloading local development workflow that is nearly identical to your deployed components. The `cms-dev-server` also enables rendering local versions of your components on live CMS pages to aid in development.

Users can start the cms-dev-server by running `hs-cms-dev-server /path/to/components-directory` in a project that has `@hubspot/cms-dev-server` installed.

For example, a CMS page with JS rendered components â€œhttps://cmssite.com/page" would be accessible by visiting one of:

- http://cmssite.com.hslocal.net:3000/page
- http://cmssite.com.localhost:3000/page

Or by visiting http://hslocal.net:3000/proxy and pasting in the page you want to proxy.

Similar to how previewing a page from the page editor works, you can force the page to render with the context of a contact by passing an `email` parameter. For example `http://cmssite.com.hslocal.net:3000/page?email=bh@hubspot.com` will cause the contact object to be populated based on the email parameter value.

You may also start the dev server with the `--ssl` option, which enables:

- https://cmssite.com.hslocal.net:3000/page
- https://cmssite.com.localhost:3000/page


## Storybook

`cms-dev-server` includes a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) integration. Pass a `--storybook` option when starting the server to start a Storybook instance alongside the built-in dev server. You may then add `.stories.jsx` files alongside your components to build stories for testing or development. At the root http://hslocal.net:3000 page there should be a link to the Storybook UI for your project.
To make building stories for HubSpot modules easier, `cms-dev-server` provides helpers to auto-generate `argTypes` based on module fields. See the [GraphQL and Storybook](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-js-building-block-examples/tree/main/graphql-storybook/gql-storybook-project/gql-storybook-app) example project for usage of `moduleStory()`.
Storybook is built with client components in mind, so components that cross island boundaries can have unexpected lifecycle behavior when rendered in a story. Because server-only components never make it to the browser, they cannot be hot reloaded and a full re-render is necessary to update the server response. To fully emulate hybrid rendering in Storybook at the cost of hot module reloading, you may use `moduleStoryWithIsland()` in your story in place of `moduleStory()`.
