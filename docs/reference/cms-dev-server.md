## Basic Usage

`@hubspot/cms-dev-server` is a package that allows users to start an Express + Vite dev server enabling an auto-reloading local development workflow that is nearly identical to your deployed components. The `cms-dev-server` also enables rendering local versions of your components on live CMS pages to aid in development.

Users can start the cms-dev-server by running `hs-cms-dev-server /path/to/components-directory` in a project that has `@hubspot/cms-dev-server` installed.

For example, a CMS page with JS rendered components â€œhttps://cmssite.com/page" would be accessible by visiting one of:

- http://cmssite.com.hslocal.net:3000/page
- http://cmssite.com.localhost:3000/page

Or by visiting http://hslocal.net:3000/proxy and pasting in the page you want to proxy.

Similar to how previewing a page from the page editor works, you can force the page to render with the context of a contact by passing an `email` parameter. For example `http://cmssite.com.hslocal.net:3000/page?email=bh@hubspot.com` will cause the contact object to be populated based on the email parameter value.

You may also start the dev server with the `--ssl` option, which enables:

- https://cmssite.com.hslocal.net:3000/page
- https://cmssite.com.localhost:3000/page

## Routes

When the CMS Dev Server for CMS React starts it will look at the directory structure and look for `partials` and `modules` within `components`. It will then dynamically create routes based on what it finds there.

### Modules

The CMS Dev Server offers two different rotes for your modules; `/preview/module/[module_name]` and `/module/[module_name]`.

#### `/preview/module/[module_name]`

You need to be "online" and "authenticated" to use this route.

The `/preview/module/[module_name]` route does talk to the HubSpot backend and behaves similarly to viewing a module in the Design Previewer.

Field values that are used rely on defaults as there is no module instance to pull from. There is no `fields` param available here for overrides.

GraphQL data is derived on the BE and there is no query from the local server to the GraphQL service.

`hublDataTemplate` is supported at this route, the assumed context is similar to that of the Design Previewer.

`Icon`, `CTA`, and other `@hubspot/cms-component` Field helpers are supported at this route.

#### `/module/[module_name]`

The `/module/[module_name]` route is rendered entirely locally without talking to the HubSpot backend.

You can work "offline" and "unauthenticated" at this route - with caveats for GraphQL.

Field values that are used are derived entirely from the Field default values and from parameter level overrides. Param level overrides can be passed via `fields` param which expects stringified JSON of fieldValues that matches what is the passed fieldValues prop (matching the fields definition structure).

GraphQL data in this context is fetched from your local machine using your local access token as the auth for the collector service. These queries are cached, but you can bust the cache with the `hsLocalQueryKey` query parameter.

`hublDataTemplate` is not supported at this route.

`hublParams` at this route will always be an empty object `{}`.

`Icon`, `CTA`, and other `@hubspot/cms-component` Field helpers are not supported at this route.

### Partials

The CMS Dev Server offer a route for partials; `/partial/[partial_file_name]`.

Partials are very thin and do not support GraphQL or `hublDataTemplate`. In the context of the dev server `hublParameters` will always be and empty object `{}`.

## Proxying Private Pages

Making use of the CMS React local dev with proxied pages is powerful. It allows you to make changed to your React modules locally and see how they will look within the context of a page. This is no less true for pages that are private via a password or other means.

### Proxied User View

Visit a private page and login with the configured method. Once authenticated Once there add `hslocal.net:3000` or `localhost:3000` to your root domain just as you would with proxying a public page. This will allow you to develop your React modules locally in the context of an authenticated live page.

When proxying a private page, if you provide an email parameter e.g. `https://mydomain.hslocal.net:3000/private-page?email=bh@hubspot.com` that email's user will be used for the `request_contact` HubL variable. This can be passed to React with the [`hublDataTemplate`](./js-modules#hublDataTemplate) feature.

### Proxied Preview

Visit the page as a "preview". You can do this from the page editor by clicking the "Preview" button and then "Open in a new tab". Once there add `hslocal.net:3000` or `localhost:3000` to your root domain. This will allow you to do local development on a private pages. Further if you pass an `email` param it will use the associated contact as context for viewing the page. Your URL in this case wil look like `http://my-domain.com.localhost:3000/private-page-path?hs_preview=[preview_key]&email=bh@hubspot.com`.

## Storybook

`cms-dev-server` includes a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) integration. Pass a `--storybook` option when starting the server to start a Storybook instance alongside the built-in dev server. You may then add `.stories.jsx` files alongside your components to build stories for testing or development. At the root http://hslocal.net:3000 page there should be a link to the Storybook UI for your project.
To make building stories for HubSpot modules easier, `cms-dev-server` provides helpers to auto-generate `argTypes` based on module fields. See the [GraphQL and Storybook](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react/tree/main/examples/graphql-storybook/gql-storybook-project/gql-storybook-app) example project for usage of `moduleStory()`.
Storybook is built with client components in mind, so components that cross island boundaries can have unexpected lifecycle behavior when rendered in a story. Because server-only components never make it to the browser, they cannot be hot reloaded and a full re-render is necessary to update the server response. To fully emulate hybrid rendering in Storybook at the cost of hot module reloading, you may use `moduleStoryWithIsland()` in your story in place of `moduleStory()`.

## Fields Type Generation

If you are using Typescript in your CMS React project, you can make use of the `--generateFieldsTypes` argument of the dev server. This command will watch for changes to the fields object that is exported from module file and create a `.types.ts` file inside of the directory of the module. You can then import this module directly into your module component and use it in the generic `ModuleProps<T>` type. As an example, if this is your `fields.jsx` file:

```tsx
// components/modules/MyModule/fields.tsx

export const fields = (
  <ModuleFields>
    <ChoiceField
      label="Choice Test"
      name="choice"
      display="select"
      choices={[
        ["choice1", "One"],
        ["choice2", "Two"],
      ]}
      default="choice1"
    />
    <NumberField label="Display on each blog post" name="numberField" />
    <FieldGroup name="defaultGroup" label="Default text" locked>
      <TextField
        label="Text Field One"
        name="textFieldOne"
        default="Text Field"
      />
      <TextField label="Text Field Two" name="textFieldTwo" />
      <NumberField label="Number Field" name="numberField" />
    </FieldGroup>
  </ModuleFields>
);
```

Running `hs-cms-dev-server [path-to-project] --generateFieldsTypes` will generate a `modules/MyModule/fields.types.ts` file with a default exported type `MyModuleFieldsType`. The above `fields.tsx` will generate this file:

```ts
// modules/MyModule/fields.types.ts

// THIS IS AN AUTOGENERATED FILE. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
// Removing the above comment will disable type generation for this module
// This file was created by @hubspot/cms-dev-server, for more information see https://github.hubspot.com/cms-react/reference/js-modules.html#module-fields
import { type DefaultValues, type ChoiceFieldType, type NumberFieldType, type TextFieldType, type GroupFieldType, type Override } from "@hubspot/cms-components/fields";
type MyModuleFieldsType = DefaultValues<{
    choice: Required<ChoiceFieldType>;
    numberField: NumberFieldType;
    defaultGroup: Override<GroupFieldType, {
        children: {
            textFieldOne: Required<TextFieldType>;
            textFieldTwo: TextFieldType;
            numberField: NumberFieldType;
        };
    }>;
}>;
export default MyModuleFieldsType;
```


Then, you can import and use the type in your component as follows:

```tsx
// components/modules/MyModule/index.tsx

import { ModuleProps } from '@hubspot/cms-components';
import MyModule from './fields.types';

export const Component = ({
  fieldValues,
  hublParameters = {},
}: ModuleProps<MyModule>) => {
  const number = fieldValues.numberField;
  //   ^?const number: number | number[] | null | undefined
  //   Note that can be undefined because no default set

  const choice = fieldValues.choice;
  //   ^?const choice: string | number | (string | number)[]

  const text = fieldValues.defaultGroup.textFieldOne
  //   ^?const text: string | null
}
```

Note that the generated types file will be overwritten every time there is an update made to the fields object. To disable this behaviour, remove the `THIS IS AN AUTOGENERATED FILE. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.` comment at the top of the file.
